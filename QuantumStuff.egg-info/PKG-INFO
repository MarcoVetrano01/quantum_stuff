This package contains usefull tools for quantum simulations and for the implementations of quantum reservoir computing and quantum extreme learning machines.
This project has been done during my PhD at the University of Palermo under the supervision of Professor Massimo Palma and Professor Salvatore Lorenzo, with whom I worked in many instances on these quantum machine learning techniques.
