## Introduction to ELMs and RCs

Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) and Reservoir Computing (RC) are supervised learning algorithms which exploit a random substrate as hidden layer in order to linearize the learning of a problem.

In particular, in literature it is possible to find many implementation of RC and ELMs which exploits both randomly initialized neural networks (Echo State Networks), but also with physical systems whose dynamics is complex enough to be used as a processor of information. 

This repository aims to be a useful tool in general for quantum computation, but in particular for the implementation of Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) and for Quantum Extreme Learning Machines (QELMs), which are peculiar implementation of RC and ELMs in which the reservoir is implemented using a quantum substrate for information processing.

This project has been done during my PhD at the University of Palermo under the supervision of Professor Massimo Palma and Professor Salvatore Lorenzo, with whom I worked in many instances on these quantum machine learning techniques, and has been done mainly as an exercise.
